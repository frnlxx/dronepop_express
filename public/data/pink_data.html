<h2>Artist's Bio</h2>
<p>Pink Flicker is a band with one member. Songwriter/noisemaker Jen Maynard's genre-eluding solo project has dabbled in post-punk, shoegaze, plunderphonics, electronic, noise-rock, folk-punk, etc. with a consistent emphasis on improvisation and spontaneity within composition. Lyrical themes of alienation, transformation, violence and the trans-experience pervade those songs which feature vocals. The first official Pink Flicker release "...And You Walk but Sink" is a brief yet potent set of folk-punk songs featuring some of her most direct and emotive lyrics (available only on Bandcamp.) The follow-up "Vague Conceptions" ditches the raw minimalist punk for experimental improvisations utilizing guitar, bass, drums, and modified vocals to create an array of dark and textured sonic explorations. 2018's "The Sickly Bop EP" stands as perhaps the most singular and cohesive of Pink Flicker projects. A four-track post-punk EP featuring the 9 minute title track about an increasingly sickly girl who ignores her symptoms due to the lack of feedback from her peers. "All Dead Ideas Were Once Very Much Alive: Pink Flicker's Un-&-Re-Released and Un-Finished 2014-2019" is exactly as it describes; a hodgepodge of songs and skeletons tracking a half-decade of tinkering with sounds and instruments.</p>
