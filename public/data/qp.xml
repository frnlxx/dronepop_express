		<description>Two rapscallions, together known as “QUEEN PLAY”, at large on the East Coast, last seen fleeing a basement rehearsal in 2019. Noted homosexual tendencies and socialist sympathies. Can be found by following primal sounds of pummeling tom toms and sizzling cymbals, rattling guitar riffs and weeping layers of 6 stringed walls of noise. While officially on an Indefinite Hiatus, we humbly ask the members of QUEEN PLAY to step forward and turn themselves back into the warm embrace of Rock N Roll. Until then, stay vigilant; there is no telling what two raucous androgynes without their outlet are capable of.</description>
